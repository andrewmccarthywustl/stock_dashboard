### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This is just a project I made and will improve with time to view my equity positions

I'm thinking about adding an GPT in some way just for fun, but still figuring out the best implementation, and I'm not trying to spend much money on expensive API calls.

I am thinking of adding more assets crypto, debt, commodities, real estate, options, but most financial data is not free and my portfolio is not big enough at the moment to justify accruing monthly costs for more data.

Website also needs a much better design and if possible I would love to port it over to Django for a little more structure in the backend, but I think I allowed for scalability and more features pretty well.

Also I need to learn how to cache better and optimize this.
